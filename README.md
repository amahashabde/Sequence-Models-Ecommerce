# Sequence-Models-Ecommerce
Sequence models applied to ecommerce use case

# Description
The goal is to predict outcomes of online browsing sessions through session-level-features or seqeunce of page visits to predict if the next sequence of events/session outcome will be a purchase or not. Working off session level data is definitely more erroneous than on a journey level, but it provides the opportunity to initiate nudge models/coupons to help personalize at each session level. The use case is that of an MLE engineer at Macy's cosmetics

# Task List
To process raw session level data to generate sequence data/sequence models. Use different sequence models RNN, LSTM, GRU and assess performance
Compare performance of sequence models with session-feature level models.
